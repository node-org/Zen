# Zen

## 📋 Overview
Zen is an Open-Source alternative to Workona, Toby, OneTab and stuff like that, Its first Node project, a node in a network

## ❓ Why?
For a long-time, I was a workona user, I emailed them multiple time to add some features and I guess once thanked them due to great service but I always felt a fear of the day they launch their new plans, which gonna make more paid options, to be honest, I thought they wont decrease current features and bait us all, but rather add new features which should be paid, so surely I went very sad, because in the middle of my exams and tasks, I lost my life, as a person with a obsessive and perfectionist personality, a sense of harmony in my workspace is essential, which was took, it was a jerk move, but didn't made me raged, rather sad, so like any other GCPD complaint company I expected them to give back data, so I went to menus clicked on export and boom, I had my data, expect it didnt contained some of info and it wasnt complete due to some sorta bug I didnt understand even till now, there was an error of maximum 300 elements reached or sth and I didnt know what is exactly making that error, and data export didnt work for me as well, so I went and did some *rage* tweets, they answered me and after that I felt what I did was a little childish, but what I was looking for was completely right and after lots of emails, they didnt gave me one correct answer, and their *technical* team said me they are facing no problem! so I felt I cant waste anymore time on these, my work is gone, and all I have is 300 workspace, but I promised myself to take a revange and also offer people a good, free for personal use alternative, so that's the cause of this project here, while I'm writing this, nothing much is done yet rather than lots of research, some design drafts, and some snippets here and there

## ⌚ Timeline

 - 10/7/2021: Workona agony and war
 - 7/1/2022: Start here
 - 15/2/2022: A Structure is Ready (Goal: v0 at Nouwruz a.k.a 21st of March, 2022)

## 🎯 Goals
 - This project is free for personal use, forever, if I made it monetized for personal use, even if I added lots of annoying ads, just fork it and kick my ass 😉!
 - Being feature-rich, I prefer bloated stuff, but for security sake I try to minimize dependency and also make nearly all codes, offline
 - Probably in version 1 there would be a notice api to just show critical notices, like security hazard and stuff like that to users, and if you wanna work offline, that is going to be all you need from internet, proabably
 - Before full documantation and writing tests this project shall not be open to contribution, It doesnt mean I wont accept any, but It means I probably wont so don't waste time if you didn't inform me about it before hand

## 🔔 Notice
 - I am not in a good life balance rn, dont expect me regular updates, but this piece of tool gonna drive me as well, so, I would treat it with care
 - There is absolutely no guruntee what so over, and I dont suggest anybody use it for production while its in version 0.*
